\title{Initialize the service provider}
\usage{
initializeProvider(provider, cluster, verbose)

\arguments{
\item{provider}{S4 CloudProvider object. The service provider}

\item{cluster}{S4 DockerCluster object}

\item{verbose}{Integer. The verbose level, default 1}
}
\description{
Initialize the service provider. This function will be called prior
to \code{runServer} and \code{runWorkers}. It is used to initialize the cloud-specific
settings(e.g. Initialize the cloud network). The function might be called many
times so developers can cache the service status and speed up the initialization
process.
}
\details{
Basic on the cloud nature, certain initialization process might be required
before deploying the container on the cloud. This function will be called by
the \code{DockerCluster} object before running the server and workers.

Besides initializing the cloud settings, if the parallel server is provided
by the cloud. The function might needs to change the value in
\code{cluster@cloudConfig$serverWorkerSameNAT} to inform \code{DockerCluster} whether the
server and the workers behind the same router. If
\code{cluster@cloudConfig$serverWorkerSameNAT} is \code{TRUE}(default), the worker will
connect with the server using the server's private IP. Otherwise, the server's
public IP will be used.

Although it is possible to change any settings in \code{cluster} in this fuction,
the best practice is to only initialize \code{provider} and
the slot \code{cluster@cloudConfig$serverWorkerSameNAT}.
